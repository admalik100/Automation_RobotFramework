<h1>RobotFrameWork Prototype</h1>

This is a prototype in progress.
Currently, it supports only one module i.e. Login Tests.

The project has been developed with Robot Framework and with python.
It is still in its early stages.
Currently, we have not integrated the use of keywords as you'll see in the code file "LoginTestCase.robot" as well.

For the project to run we require RobotFramework, Robotframework-selenium library and chromedriver (installed in system path)

I have tried creating the requirement.txt file via the sync python requirement however the file is empty , packages are not being loaded into it, Currently looking into it.

<p>Future features to be supported:</p>
<p>More modules.</p>
<p>Commenting</p>
<p>more use of documentation and keywords</p>
